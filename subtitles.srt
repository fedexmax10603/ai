1
00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:01.606
Host:  Sir, you there.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.240
Host: Are you going to teach your son to be a fighter?

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.614
Host:  Are you bringing him up to be a fighter?

4
00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:07.220
Ali: No, sir.

5
00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:14.019
Ali:  My son is already, he's two years old and we're starting, we want him to learn three languages.

6
00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:18.256
Ali:  Arabic, French and Spanish.

7
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:26.619
Ali:  My son is going to, by the time he's where he is, we in America would have had what we call Iron Independence for now.

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.796
Ali:  The separation we preach would have been taking place in maybe another, less than ten years.

9
00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:32.478
Ali: This is going to happen.

10
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:34.064
Ali:  God's going to force it.

11
00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:38.980
Ali: By then, he's going to be a hope to be a world traveler and interpreter, talking to other people.

12
00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:43.513
Ali:  In French, most, many African people speak only French.

13
00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.779
Ali: Many darker people speak Spanish.

14
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:50.357
Ali:  And he's going to have to do a lot of traveling and ambassador work and doing different things I plan.

15
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:57.539
Ali:  He's learning these three, he's two years old and we're getting him ready now for Arabic, French and Spanish.

16
00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:00.396
Ali:  And so he ain't going to be no fighter, he's going to use his brain.

17
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:02.329
Host:  Why wouldn't you let him be a fighter?

18
00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:03.396
Ali: For what?

19
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.248
Host:  Well, I mean, you're a fighter.

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.557
Host: I mean, why would you let him?

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.889
Host:  I had to be a fighter.

22
00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:08.919
Host: You would have been something else.

23
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.920
Ali:  If I could have went to school and got an education and could speak say three or four languages fluently and got a good trade in life, I'd forget all about fighting.

24
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.306
Host:  Would you?

25
00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:18.980
Host: Yeah.

26
00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.000
Host:  When you were at school, I mean, did you miss out on education?

27
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:22.987
Host:  No, I didn't miss out.

28
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:23.671
Ali: I wouldn't learn.

29
00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:25.000
Ali: I didn't know the value of it.

30
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.779
Ali:  I was a little black boy in Kentucky, didn't know nothing about I'd be on your show, didn't know nothing about I'd be a world champion, playing hooky, playing with the girls,

31
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:42.000
Ali:  not just going to recess and eating lunch and joking, not knowing the value of education like many children do in the day, never thinking that one day I'll have to feed myself,

32
00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:47.000
Ali:  didn't have no idea of profit and getting out and making money like a lot of children do.

33
00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:53.000
Ali:  And time went by and I graduated and I won the Olympics and they put me out just because I could fight.

34
00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.034
Ali:  And my mom was mainly on sports.

35
00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:56.000
Ali: They just let me go.

36
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.779
Ali:  And all of a sudden I find myself having trouble reading things, looking at contracts, got to hire lawyers, to watch lawyers.

37
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.389
Ali:  I know the value of education now.

38
00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.000
Ali: So I'm going to brainwash my children now.

39
00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:06.028
Ali:  My daughter is six years old.

40
00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:08.900
Ali: She speaks Arabic, English, and Spanish.

41
00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:09.735
Host:  That was interesting.

42
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:10.000
Ali: She's six.

43
00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:16.499
Host:  In fact, when you were in school, Muhammad, were you in fact semi-literate in the sense that you're difficult to read?

44
00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.000
Host: Could you read properly?

45
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.484
Ali:  No, not that type of literate.

46
00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:23.980
Ali: I have a wisdom that can make me talk to you, an educated man, on any subject.

47
00:02:24.503 --> 00:02:26.940
Ali:  And if the audience or the people listen, they'll say I won.

48
00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:29.184
Ali:  Now, I'll say this.

49
00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:30.226
Ali: No, I'm serious.

50
00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:38.000
Ali: I have the type of knowledge that Jesus had, Moses had, Abraham, Elijah, Muhammad, men are illiterates according to your educational standards.

51
00:02:39.044 --> 00:02:40.992
Ali:  Moses was so illiterate he couldn't talk.

52
00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:42.418
Ali: His brother Aaron talked for him.

53
00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:42.980
Ali: Jesus was a carpenter.

54
00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:44.849
Ali:  No, a lot.

55
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:47.000
Ali: All of God's prophets were uneducated men.

56
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:52.355
Ali:  This is why he chooses them because he won't nobody to take the credit for his success.

57
00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:52.957
Ali: He's God.

58
00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:53.880
Ali: He takes them empty and teach them.

59
00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:57.472
Ali:  So I've been taught by Elijah and Muhammad.

60
00:02:57.773 --> 00:02:58.595
Ali: I studied life.

61
00:02:58.676 --> 00:02:59.498
Ali: I studied people.

62
00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:00.000
Ali: And I'm educated on this.

63
00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:03.317
Ali:  But when it comes to reading and writing, I'm not.

64
00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:04.000
Ali: I may be illiterate in that.

65
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:13.000
Ali:  But when it comes to common sense, when it comes to feelings, when it comes to love, compassion, heart for people, then I'm rich.

66
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.434
Ali:  I wrote someone who says, where is man's wealth?

67
00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.000
Ali: His wealth is in his knowledge.

68
00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:24.000
Ali:  For if his wealth was in the bank and not in his knowledge, then he don't possess it because it's in the bank.

69
00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:26.807
Ali:  My wealth is in my knowledge.

70
00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:28.471
Ali: See, I'm a boxer.

71
00:03:28.912 --> 00:03:29.754
Ali: And I challenge.

72
00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.000
Ali: I love to come on your show because you ask me good questions.

73
00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:34.547
Ali:  I really like a man like you.

74
00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.613
Ali: You asked me a question here that was good.

75
00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:37.997
Ali: You didn't write that.

76
00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:38.980
Ali: It was already in the book.

77
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.245
Ali:  You just brought it out.

78
00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.329
Ali: You found that.

79
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:43.980
Ali: See, ain't nobody else wise enough to go find that.

80
00:03:44.502 --> 00:03:45.826
Ali:  See, I like people like you.

81
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:46.769
Ali: You make me think.

82
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.137
Ali: You keep me sharp because I'm a spokesman for my people.

83
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:51.268
Ali:  And I want to represent my people.

84
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.980
Ali: And I don't want to be a bad representative.

85
00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:55.396
Ali:  I can't be blind because the blind lead the blind.

86
00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.000
Ali: They all fall in the ditch.

87
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.249
Ali:  So I need people like you to match with.

88
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.036
Ali: George Foreman can't talk to you now.

89
00:04:00.297 --> 00:04:01.000
Ali: Joe Frazier can't talk to you.

90
00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:02.913
Ali:  You'll eat him up.

91
00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:03.859
Ali: How you feel, Joe?

92
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:07.672
Ali:  I'm a little sick tomorrow every day.

93
00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:08.515
Ali: I mean, not me.

94
00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:09.699
Ali: I mean, left everything I got to have.

95
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.323
Ali:  You know, I'm not like that.

96
00:04:11.343 --> 00:04:12.306
Ali: I don't want to be like that.

97
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:17.940
Ali: I want to be intelligent, nice looking, get my briefcase fixed up, dress up, put my boat down,

98
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.000
Ali:  and go give a nice lecture to Harvard University on the intoxications of life, or have a lecture entitled, The Purpose of Life,

99
00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:29.960
Ali:  or The Art of Personality, or The Journey to the Golden Life, or Like the Heart of Man, all type of lectures,

100
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.000
Ali:  The Solution to the Black and White Conflict, Religious Draft, you understand?

101
00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:36.365
Ali:  I like to study.

102
00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:40.980
Ali: And like what you hear now, things people never heard, I could go on and on and on on different subjects.

103
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.898
Ali:  You understand?
